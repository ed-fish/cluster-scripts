# Cluster Scripts

Helpful tools I built for working with my university gpu cluster. 

`gpu-check` Connects to all machines on the cluster via ssh and prints the available memory.

`push-script` `-f, -h` Pushes file to all nodes and makes executable.

`ssh-gen` Generates and stores ssh keys for all machines on cluster for ease of use.
